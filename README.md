# FAQ (Or, things I wish you'd ask)

Hello, first of all thank you for joining us.
It's great to see the community come out and
participate.

It's a concurrent webserver I wrote to deliver
the static content for my homepage, [donny.nyc](https://donny.nyc).
It's written in C, and fully-baked weighs in at just over 18K.

David Horne [wrote a chess program for the ZX81 using under 1K](https://thad.frogley.info/archive/the_greatest_program.html), so
no big deal.
