# FAQ (Or, things I wish you'd ask)

## You made something! What is it?
Hello, first of all thank you for joining us.
It's great to see the community come out and
participate.

It's a concurrent webserver I wrote to deliver
the static content for my homepage, [donny.nyc](https://donny.nyc).
It's written in C, and fully-baked weighs in at just over 18K.

An interesting side note: David Horne [wrote a chess program for the ZX81 using under 1K](https://thad.frogley.info/archive/the_greatest_program.html).

## Ok, but why?
To justify purchasing [Unix Network Programming, Volume 1](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/258607.Unix_Network_Programming_Volume_1) by W. Richard Stevens.

Which I bought to justify purchasing an enterprise-grade [HPE BladeSystem](https://buy.hpe.com/us/en/options/enclosures-chassis/bladesystem-c-class-enclosures/bladesystem-c-class-enclosures/hpe-bladesystem-c3000-enclosures/p/3540808).

Because, covid?
